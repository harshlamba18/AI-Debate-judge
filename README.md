uvicorn ai_judge_free:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

10. **To test the real-time features of the application (like a chat or debate), you need to simulate two different users.

Open your first browser (e.g., Chrome) and go to:
http://localhost:3000

Open a second, different browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari) or a private/incognito window in your first browser. Go to the same address:
http://localhost:3000

You can now use the application from both browser windows as if you were two separate users.**
